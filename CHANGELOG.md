- Potential to duplicate transactions if used with Component based framework i.e. React/Vue
  - This included creating a react example page in a separate repository to verify the library works in React - this can be viewed at https://github.com/SecureTrading/reactjs-payments

### Changed

- Refactored payment card out to separate js-payments-card repo and ts-modules for code re-use
- Dependencies updated:
  - @babel/runtime - 7.8.4
  - @securetrading/js-payments-card - 1.0.7
  - @securetrading/ts-iin-lookup - NEW - 0.0.4
  - @securetrading/ts-luhn-check - NEW - 0.0.4
  - i18next - 19.1.0
  - url-polyfill - 1.1.8

## 2.0.3

### Fixed

- Updated dependencies and fixed vulnerabilities (eg. Prototype Pollution in Handlebars - [CVE-2019-19919](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w457-6q6x-cgp9)).

## 2.0.2

### Fixed

- Resolved serialize-javascript dependency: regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Updated bunch of packages.
- Fixed a bug which could cause duplicate payments if deferInit=true

- Add updateJWT function to allow JWT to be changed after initial load. E.g. this could be used to change the amount the customer will be charged if the checkout allows modification to the cart contents after initial load.

### Changed

- Add option for buttonId in config to allow a specific button to be targetted as the pay button (previously this was always targetting the first button only). If not specified this will keep the original behavior.
